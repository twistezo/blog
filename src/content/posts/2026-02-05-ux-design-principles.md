## Keep in mind

- they apply to web, mobile, and physical interfaces
- they work together—combining multiple principles creates better UX
- context matters; sometimes principles conflict—trust your research
- they're not laws of physics; they're heuristics with exceptions
- user testing beats theory every time

## Foundation

### Clarity

> make it obvious

Users shouldn't guess. Ambiguity kills conversions.

- "Buy Now" button
- Clear error message
- Obvious CTAs

### Consistency

> reuse familiar patterns

Consistency reduces cognitive load—users learn once, apply everywhere.

- Same navigation across pages
- Standard icons
- Predictable interactions

### Simplicity

> less clutter, fewer steps

Every element must earn its space.

- Single-step checkout
- Minimal form fields
- Reduced clutter

### Accessibility

> design for all users

Accessibility isn't optional—it's legal and it expands your audience.

- Alt text for images
- High-contrast text
- Keyboard navigation
- Captions

### Feedback

> show results of actions

Users need confirmation that their action registered.

- Loading spinner
- Button color change
- Success messages

### Progressive Disclosure

> reveal complexity gradually

Beginners see basics; power users find depth.

- "Advanced settings" toggle
- Collapsible FAQ
- Details on demand

## Design Systems

### Defaults & Choice Architecture

> defaults shape behavior

Users rarely change defaults—choose wisely.

- Newsletter opt-in checked
- Preselected shipping method
- Default settings handle complexity

### Consistency at Scale

> Jakob's Law—users expect familiarity

Familiar patterns need no explanation; they borrow trust from other products.

- Cart like Amazon
- Login like Gmail

### Aesthetic Usability

> attractive = feels easier

Beauty doesn't just please—it makes interfaces _feel_ more usable.

- Clean product page
- Minimal UI design
- Polished interactions

## Perception & Cognition

### Hick's Law

> more choices = slower decisions

Every option adds friction to the decision.

- 3 pricing plans
- Short dropdown lists

### Miller's Law

> ~7±2 items fit in working memory

Chunk information beyond that limit—group related items, use progressive disclosure.

- Max 7 nav items
- 5-step signup wizard

### Tesler's Law

> complexity must live somewhere

Choose your burden strategically.

- Multi-step setup wizard
- Default settings handle complexity

### Doherty Threshold

> respond in <400ms to keep flow

Users forgive waiting if _something_ happens fast. Lag breaks immersion.

- Instant search results
- Autocomplete suggestions

## Visual Design (Gestalt Principles)

### Hierarchy

> guide attention with layout and contrast

Your layout teaches users what matters first.

- Large headline
- Bold primary CTA
- Strategic white space

### Proximity

> close = related

Users naturally group nearby elements.

- Label next to input
- Button near form

### Similarity

> look alike = grouped

Visual similarity broadcasts relationships without text.

- Same color buttons
- Matching card styles

### Continuity

> eyes follow lines and flows

Eyes naturally trace smooth lines over jagged ones.

- Timeline layout
- Stepper flow

### Closure

> people complete missing shapes

Brains fill in the blanks—use this to reduce visual clutter.

- WWF panda logo
- Dashed circle looks complete

### Figure/Ground

> foreground vs. background contrast

Clear figure/ground separation prevents confusion.

- Modal overlay
- White text on dark hero image

### Common Region

> grouped area = related

Enclosure signals: "these things belong together."

- Card with border
- Section box around inputs

## Human Psychology

### Peak-End Rule

> users remember peaks and endings

People don't remember the average experience—they remember the best and last moments.

- Reward animation
- Checkout confirmation

### Von Restorff Effect

> unique = remembered

Distinctiveness captures attention and sticks in memory.

- Red "Delete" button
- Highlighted promo

### Zeigarnik Effect

> unfinished tasks stick in mind

Unfinished business nags—use this to drive engagement, but don't abuse it.

- Incomplete profile reminder
- Progress bar

### Goal-Gradient Effect

> motivation rises near completion

Progress toward a goal energises users—make progress visible.

- 8/10 loyalty stamps
- "2 steps left"

## Interaction

### Fitts's Law

> bigger and closer = faster to click

Reduce distance and size targets for frequent actions.

- Large mobile CTA
- Sticky bottom nav buttons

### Norman's 3 Levels

> objects have three layers: looks, use, meaning

Great design balances all three.

- Luxury watch (looks)
- Intuitive controls (use)
- Apple design language (meaning)

### Kano Model

> features layer differently

Must-haves prevent dissatisfaction; delighters create surprise. Know which tier your feature occupies.

- Calls = basic
- FaceID = delight

## Approach

### Empathy

> design around user needs

Walk through your interface as a beginner—what confuses you?

- Step-by-step onboarding
- Helpful tooltips
- User-friendly language

## Closing Thoughts

These principles aren't rigid rules—they're patterns backed by cognitive science and user behaviour. The strongest designs layer multiple principles together: clarity (foundation) + hierarchy (visual) + consistency (systems) + empathy (approach). Start with research to understand your users' actual needs; then apply principles strategically to serve those needs.
